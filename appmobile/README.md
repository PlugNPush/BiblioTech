This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server and the Emulator

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro we only need `npm start`, but if you want to launch also the _emulator_, run the following command from this location:

### For Android
```bash
# using npm
npm start --android
```

### For iOS
```bash
# using npm
npm start --ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see the app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
